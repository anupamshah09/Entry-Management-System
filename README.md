# Entry Management System

**Innovacer Summer geeks 2020 Assignment for SDE.**
 
 The **Problem Statement** on which I am working is as follows:  
Given the visitors that we have in office and outside, there is a need to for an *entry management software*, We need an application, which can capture the *name, email address, phone no* of the *visitor* and the same information also needs to be captured for the host on the front end. At the back end, once the user enters the information in the form, the backend should store all of the information with time stamp of the entry.
 
 **Prerequisites**
  1) Install [MySql Connector]( https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/)
2) Allow Access For [less secure apps](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) in your Gmail account.
3) [Sign up](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) on Twilio and you will get number, account_sid and auth_token to use the following messaging services.
4) Enter the details about your twilio token and sid,Gmail account,Gmail password,MySQL in the file config.py.
5) Use the package manager [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required packages.
6) Run the entry.py file.

The various technologies used by me in this project are [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) for messaging services, MySql ,Python, SMTP for E-mail (ing) services and Tkinter for User Interface.
